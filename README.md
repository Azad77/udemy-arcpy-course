## Course Overview
In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of **ArcPy**â€”a Python library used for automating spatial analysis and geospatial data management in **ArcGIS**. The course covers the following topics:
- Introduction to ArcPy
- Working with spatial data
- Automating map creation and geospatial analysis
- Implementing custom geospatial tools
- Integrating ArcPy with other Python libraries

## Installation

To get started, you need to have **ArcGIS** and **ArcPy** installed on your machine.

1. **Install ArcGIS**: Follow the official [ArcGIS installation guide](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/arcmap/installation-and-setup.htm).
2. **Set up Python and ArcPy**: ArcPy is included with ArcGIS Desktop, so once you have ArcGIS installed, Python and ArcPy will be available.

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azad77/udemy-arcpy-course.git
```
Usage
After setting up the repository, you can start using the provided code. Here's an example of how to use a script from this course:

```python
import arcpy
```
# Example of running a simple ArcPy function
```
arcpy.Buffer_analysis("input.shp", "output.shp", "10 meters")
```
Make sure you replace "input.shp" with the path to your actual shapefile.
